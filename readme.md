# Memory Match Template in Phaser 3
> A template project for a Memory Match game as found in Mario Party 🎉

## Overview

This is an example or template project for a Memory Match game like the mini-game found in Mario Party.

The player controls a character that moves around to select different boxes. Each box has an item with a corresponding match in another box. A whammy box causes the player to be unresponsive for 1 second.
